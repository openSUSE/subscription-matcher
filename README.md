# Introduction

`subscription-matcher` is an open source program by SUSE that utilizes the [Drools](https://www.drools.org/) rule engine and the [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/) constraint solver to determine whether a set of installed SUSE products matches a set of SUSE subscriptions.

At the moment, it is an internal component of SUSE Manager.
